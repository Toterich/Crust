# Crust - C compiler written in Rust

This serves only educational purposes for myself at the moment. The intended goal is to
* Learn the Rust programming language
* Learn the inner workings of compilers

## Desired features for v0.1
* Compilation of a single, arbitrary C source file into x86-64 assembly code
* Handling of ASCII input files only
* No 'typedef' support (as that makes parsing more difficult)
* No Preprocessor
